                Working at Keywords as an FQA Tester for three summers allowed me to gain experience in multiple facets important to large software development cycles.  
                Specifically, I have acquired skills in <strong>professional bug report writing</strong>, <strong>communication in large teams</strong>, <strong>JIRA databases</strong>, and <strong>task prioritization and multitasking in order to maximise efficiency</strong>.  
                Overall I feel like my time at Keywords was an invaluable experience and all of the skills I learned will help me for almost any large software project.

                Physics (and Maths) Tutor: John Abbott College Science Club
            </h3>
            <h4>

                Working as a physics and maths tutor for the John Abbott College Science Club helped me develop an excellent ability to come up with <strong>clear and concise explanations</strong>.  
                Additionally it helped me in developing my <strong>self-learning skills</strong>, because in order to properly explain concepts to students I had to rigorously study and learn the educational material in question.
                I feel as though one of the best methods of solidifying concepts in your brain is through teaching them to others, so the experience I gained in learning a <strong>multitude of different teaching methods</strong> is an invaluable skill.

                Volunteering as a mentor to <strong>provide guidance and support to students (grade 7-11) in developing a STEM skillset</strong>, specifically focusing on robotics, helped develop my ability to teach complicated systems to young and less scientifically developed minds.
                This also helped me in developing my <strong>self-learning skills</strong>, because in order to properly explain concepts to students I had to rigorously study and learn the STEM material in question.
